//! Threshold ECDSA for Fedimint federations, wrapping the audited
//! [`cggmp21`] implementation (CGGMP21 protocol, Kudelski-audited).
//!
//! This crate is transport-agnostic: protocol runners take a
//! [`round_based::MpcParty`], and the caller supplies message delivery.
//! It must not depend on fedimint-core; consensus/p2p wiring lives in the
//! server module that consumes this crate.

/// The only curve this crate supports.
